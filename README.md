This repo demonstrates a couple bugs related to TypeScript linting when the inlayHints feature is enabled. The workspace config has typescript.inlayHints.parameterNames.enabled set to "literals". After opening the project, if you open either composeRepro.ts or reduceRepro.ts (or both), you'll see linting errors in both files. However, if you make any modifications to either file or restart the TypeScript server, the errors go away. However, restarting VS Code will cause the linting errors to reappear. Disabling the inlayHints feature prevents the error from appearing in the first place.
